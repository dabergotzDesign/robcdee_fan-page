                            Everytime it is 8:31 in Japan, the chat spams for one minute the emote.

                            when he's talking japanese it often comes to 'lost in translation' situations or Rob doesn't understand at all,
                            but playing it like he would understand.

                <h2>Highlight Streams</h2>

                <h3>Halloween</h3>
                <p>
                    Halloween in Tokyo is always an highlight as dozens of people gather together in different costumes,
                    the time where also the most degenerate people are the loudest and having fun.
                    RobcDee costumes are also a highlight as he really wants also some interaction with the party folks.
                    For example Halloween 2022 he did go as Wheel of Fortune (Spin to Win). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XaKQTxurh0" target="_blank">Here to see</a> 
                </p>

                <h3>New Years Eve / Degentime</h3>
                <p>                   
                    Like the Halloween streams this one has also all the party folk there. Those streams are high likely to be 24 hour long, as is it also tradition to
                    see the first sunrise for the new year.
                    <br>
                    The day after or two, the people of Japan are then go to the shrines & temples to see their fortune for the year. With Tracy having not so much luck.

                <h3>Silverdale Co-streams</h3>
                <p>
                    
                    The streamer Silverdale is a V-tuber streamer, she and Rob, as host, shows her around Tokyo and together the stream is getting more interactive with
                    the reactions Silver has about the things happen at Robs side.
